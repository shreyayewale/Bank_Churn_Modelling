# Bank-Churn-Modelling
# Objective
To build a predictive model to determine whether a bank customer is likely to churn based on various customer attributes.

# Data Source
The dataset used for this project contains information about bank customers, including their demographics, account information, and whether they have churned.

# Project Steps
Import Libraries:- Python libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning are imported.

Import Data:- The dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame.

Describe Data:- Initial data exploration to understand the structure and summary statistics.

Data Visualization:- Visualize the distribution of the target variabl.

Data Preprocessing:- Dropping Unnecessary Columns: Removing columns that are not needed for the prediction. Encoding Categorical Variables: Converting categorical variables into numerical values. Scaling Features: Scaling numerical features to standardize them.

Define Target Variable (y) and Feature Variables (X):- Separating the dataset into features (X) and target (y).

Train Test Split:- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

Model Evaluation:- Evaluating the modelâ€™s performance using confusion matrix, accuracy score, and classification report.

Prediction:- Using the trained model to make predictions on new data.
